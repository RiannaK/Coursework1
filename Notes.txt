Things to ask:
Do we include the build/distribution folders (from install of setup.py) on github or should i add to .gitignore
Can we change the code - readability...
How do you expect to install the python package. Should it be via "python setup.py install" or should it be using the "pip" keyword? (pg 237-239 of notes)


Things for report:
from - didn't work
issues in github - closed out issues when we committed
travis continuous integration - travis is very useful and he automatically installs pytest and mock. 


Things to do:
License and those files
--help comes out as optional
